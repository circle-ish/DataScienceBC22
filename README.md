# DataScienceBC22
This collection of projects is a part of the [Data Science Bootcamp by WBS CodingSchool](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp/).  Other WBS CS projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/WBSCodingSchool).

## Project Intro
The purpose of these projects are to acquaint myself with the techniques and tools of a data scientist. 
* proj2: exploring the influence of price discounts for the fictional eCommerce retailer Eniac 
* proj3: using web scraping and open APIs to gather data for informed decisions to optimise business decisions for the fictional scooter operator Gans 

### Collaborations
On each project I worked with a number of fellow students from the same DataScience Bootcamp batch:

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Each project contains a main.ipynb that guides through the process.

## Featured Data and Deliverables
* proj2: Google Slides ["An investigation into Eniac’s discount strategy"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h76Fz6eDDT8DPktf8YEF953KTxp-ny33GF0PS2D31e4/edit#slide=id.p)
* proj2: the data used for Eniac comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
* proj3: requires API keys from from [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) and [rapidAPI/aerodatabox](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox)
