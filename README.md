# DataScienceBC22
This collection of projects is a part of the [Data Science Bootcamp by WBS CodingSchool](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp/).  Other WBS CS projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/WBSCodingSchool).

## Project Intro
The purpose of these projects are to acquaint myself with the techniques and tools of a data scientist. 
* proj2: exploring the influence of price discounts for the fictional eCommerce retailer Eniac 
* proj3: using web scraping and open APIs to gather data for informed decisions to optimise business decisions for the fictional scooter operator Gans 

### Collaborations
On each project I worked with a number of fellow students from the same DataScience Bootcamp batch:
